Mandatory Techniques : 

Use Perspective Camera // Done
Textures in your 3D Models // Done
Implement Ambient, Diffuse & Specular // Done
First Persom Camera Movement // Done
Have to use Vertex&Fragment Shader (Geometry Shader not mandatory) // Done

Core techniques (1):
o Deferred Rendering ********************** ROOM 4 **********************
o Skeletal Animation (M3D, FBX, Collada, etc)

- Geometry (2):
o Parsing and rendering an existing model format (OBJ, FBX, Collada,
etc). This includes parsing and using the material defined in the
format (textures) // Done. Just add the Material thing
o Height-map terrain rendering, user can walk on the terrain
o Displacement mapping using Tessellation hardware
o Level of Detail using Tessellation
o Morph-based vertex animation

- Texturing and Lighting (1):
o Normal mapping ********************** ROOM 2 **********************
o Dynamic Ambient Occlusion
o Blend mapping (multi-texturing)

- Projection Techniques (1):
o Shadow mapping ********************** ROOM 1 **********************
o Shadow volumes
o Dynamic cubic environment mapping
o Dynamic paraboloid mapping

- Acceleration Techniques (2):
o View frustum culling against a quadtree
o Occlusion culling
o Back face culling using Geometry Shader ********************** ROOM 3 **********************

Other techniques (2):
o Particle systems with billboarded particles ********************** FINAL WINNING ROOM **********************
o Gaussian filter
o Bilateral filter
o Mouse Picking
o Screen-Space Antialiasing
o Water-effect
o Glow-effect
o Solve any technique listed in this category using Compute Shaders
o Make a small game in your application ********************** FINAL ROOM ********************** 

 en mål-tavla rör sig på väggen randomly, man måste försöka skjuta den o pricka mitten. Man får poäng etc - 
Saker faller från taket, man måste fånga dom, tappar man 3 saker förlorar man.

I will combine particle effcts and small game. The game will only be played in a room. you will be able to 
press a button to start the game only if you're inside the room. You get a character, and things will be falling from the roof and 


3D Text Adventure game. You enter a room. There are 2 paths, left and right. If you press Left/Right arrow key, you are taken to  a new room with new paths.
Each room has a question, and a right or wrong. If you choose the wrong path( answer the question wrong) you go back to square one. After 3 questions.
You win. You will go to a room where particles will be shooting from the ground up and a sign saying CONGRATS YOU WON. 

Question 1 - What number do you get when you multiply all of the numbers on a telephone's number pad? Answer - 0
Question 2 - Poor people have it. Rich people need it. If you eat it you die. What is it? - Answer: Nothing.
Question 3 - What Occurs once in a minute, twice in a moment and never in a thousand years - Answer: The letter M
